# Beyond the Final Frontier  - Ludum Dare 34

When the mysterious warp gates were discovered it lead to a new age of colonization. The new colonies were seldom self-sustaining, which offered a unique opportunity for business-minded explorers like yourself.  
In this game you grow colonies and control the whole game using only two buttons!

My entry to the 34:th Ludum Dare game jam (theme: Two Button Controls / Growing), following the compo rules (alone, from scratch, 48 hours).

[Play the game in Your browser](https://aggrathon.github.io/LudumDare34/), [download the game here](https://github.com/Aggrathon/LudumDare34/releases), or check out the [Ludum Dare entry](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=preview&uid=37874) (dead link)!

## Tips

- The intro, trade and upgrade dialogs can be controlled using the right and left buttons (<- left option, -> right option, <- + -> middle option).
- The main menu can be toggled with the button in the top right corner.
- Updates and story will be delivered in the lower right corner.
- To "complete" the game use the warp gates a couple of times and grow a colony to size 6.
- In the menu there is an option to steer the ship using the mouse if the two-button steering becomes too cumbersome. The ship will follow the mouse pointer, use left button for missile and right for shield.
- There is currently a bug not resetting the amount of pirates when restarting ingame , to avoid this quit and restart the whole game.
